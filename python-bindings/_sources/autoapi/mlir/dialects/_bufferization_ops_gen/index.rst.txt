.. py:class:: AllocTensorOp(result, dynamic_sizes, *, copy=None, size_hint=None, memory_space=None, loc=None, ip=None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`_ods_ir`


   
   ``bufferization.alloc_tensor`` materializes an uninitialized tensor with a
   given shape (dynamic or static). It always bufferizes to a new buffer
   allocation of the given shape. The optional ``copy`` operand specifies the
   contents of the tensors. If no ``copy`` operand is specified, reading from the
   result of an ``alloc_tensor`` op yields an undefined value.

   If ``copy`` is specified, no dynamic sizes should be passed, since they are
   the same as the dynamic sizes of the ``copy`` operand.

   ``alloc_tensor`` is a helper op for bufferization. The operation is provided
   as an anchor that marks the beginning of a new tensor SSA use-def chain. It
   can be used to control in-place bufferization decisions during One-Shot
   Bufferize: The bufferized result of a ``bufferization.alloc_tensor`` does not
   alias with any other buffer, so it can be used to resolve read-after-write
   conflicts that would have been introduced by the in-place bufferization of
   another op.

   The optional ``memory_space`` attribute specifies the memory space when
   bufferizing this op. The memory space is inferred from ``copy`` if specified.
   If neither ``copy`` nor ``memory_space`` is specified, the default memory space
   is used during bufferization.

   The optional ``size_hint`` operand specifies the number of non-zero elements
   for sparse tensors. The value of ``size_hint`` should be not less than 1 and
   not larger than the linear size of the corresponding dense tensor type. If
   this requirement is not met, the behavior of the operator is undefined.

   Both dense and sparse tensor types are supported. The result of a
   ``bufferization.alloc_tensor`` is a tensor value that can be used like any
   other tensor value. In practice, it is often used as the "out" operand of
   another op. Sparse tensor allocations should always be used in a local
   construction operation and never escape the function boundary directly.

   Example:

   .. code:: mlir

       %c = bufferization.alloc_tensor(%d1, %d2) : tensor<?x?xf32, #SparseMatrix>
       %0 = linalg.matmul
         ins(%a, %b: tensor<?x?xf32, #SparseMatrix>, tensor<?x?xf32, #SparseMatrix>)
         outs(%c: tensor<?x?xf32, #SparseMatrix>) -> tensor<?x?xf32, #SparseMatrix>
       return %0 : tensor<?x?xf32, #SparseMatrix>

   .. code:: mlir

       %c = bufferization.alloc_tensor(%d1, %d2) size_hint = %noe
         : tensor<?x?xf32, #SparseMatrix>

   Note: An ``alloc_tensor`` with a ``copy`` should also be expressed as an
   ``alloc_tensor`` without ``copy``, followed by a ``copy_tensor``.

.. py:class:: CloneOp(output, input, *, loc=None, ip=None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`_ods_ir`


   
   Clones the data in the input view into an implicitly defined output view.

   Usage:

   .. code:: mlir

       %arg1 = bufferization.clone %arg0 : memref<?xf32> to memref<?xf32>

   Valid implementations of this operation may alias the input and output
   views or create an actual copy. Mutating the source or result
   of the clone operation after the clone operation thus leads to undefined
   behavior.


   .. py:attribute:: OPERATION_NAME
      :value: 'bufferization.clone'



   .. py:attribute:: _ODS_REGIONS

.. py:class:: DeallocOp(memrefs, conditions, retained, *, results=None, loc=None, ip=None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`_ods_ir`


   
   This operation deallocates each of the given memrefs if there is no alias
   to that memref in the list of retained memrefs and the corresponding
   condition value is set. This condition can be used to indicate and pass on
   ownership of memref values (or in other words, the responsibility of
   deallocating that memref). If two memrefs alias each other, only one will be
   deallocated to avoid double free situations.

   The number of variadic ``memref`` operands (the memrefs to be deallocated)
   must equal the number of variadic ``condition`` operands and correspond to
   each other element-wise.

   The ``memref`` operands must be the originally allocated memrefs, however, the
   ``retained`` memref operands may be arbitrary memrefs.

   This operation returns a variadic number of ``updatedConditions`` operands,
   one updated condition per retained memref. An updated condition indicates
   the ownership of the respective retained memref. It is computed as the
   disjunction of all ``conditions`` operands where the corresponding to
   ``memrefs`` operand aliases with the retained memref. If the retained memref
   has no aliases among ``memrefs``, the resulting updated condition is 'false'.
   This is because all memrefs that need to be deallocated within one basic
   block should be added to the same ``bufferization.dealloc`` operation at the
   end of the block; if no aliasing memref is present, then it does not have to
   be deallocated and thus we don't need to claim ownership. If the memrefs to
   be deallocated are split over multiple dealloc operations (e.g., to avoid
   aliasing checks at runtime between the ``memref`` operands), then the results
   have to be manually combined using an ``arith.ori`` operation and all of them
   still require the same list of ``retained`` memref operands unless the
   (potentially empty) set of aliasing memrefs can be determined statically. In
   that case, the ``updatedCondition`` operand can be replaced accordingly (e.g.,
   by a canonicalizer).

   Example:

   .. code:: mlir

       %0:3 = bufferization.dealloc (%a0, %a1 : memref<2xf32>, memref<4xi32>)
         if (%cond0, %cond1) retain (%r0, %r1, %r2 : memref<?xf32>, memref<f64>,
         memref<2xi32>)

   Deallocation will be called on ``%a0`` if ``%cond0`` is 'true' and neither
   ``%r0``, ``%r1``, or ``%r2`` are aliases of ``%a0``. ``%a1`` will be deallocated when
   ``%cond1`` is set to 'true' and none of ``%r0``, ``%r1``, ``%r2``, and ``%a0`` are
   aliases.

   Note that this can be an expensive operation if there are many operands that
   cannot be optimized away. The runtime cost of this operation (assuming that
   nothing is optimized away) is ``O(|memrefs|^2+|memrefs|*|retained|)``. The
   cost in terms of memory space is ``O(|memrefs|+|retained|)``. As a result, it
   is recommended to place it carefully in the IR such that most operands can
   be optimized away by running the ``buffer-deallocation-simplification`` pass.

   Bases: :py:obj:`_ods_ir`


   
   ``bufferization.dealloc_tensor`` is a buffer deallocation in tensor land. This
   op can be used for manual buffer deallocation. Some bufferizations (such as
   One-Shot Bufferize) take care of buffer deallocation, in which case this op
   is usually not needed. Details can be found in the documentation of the
   respective bufferization passes.

   In case of a dense tensor, this op lowers to a ``memref.dealloc`` op during
   bufferization.

   In case of a sparse tensor, this op releases the underlying sparse storage
   format for a tensor that materialized earlier through a ``new`` operation, a
   ``convert`` operation with annotated destination tensor type (unless the
   convert is folded away), or a ``bufferization.alloc_tensor`` operation. The
   release operation should only be called once for any materialized tensor.
   After this operation, any subsequent ``memref`` querying operation on the
   tensor returns undefined results.

   Example:

   .. code:: mlir

       bufferization.dealloc_tensor %tensor : tensor<1024x1024xf64, #CSR>


   .. py:attribute:: OPERATION_NAME
      :value: 'bufferization.dealloc_tensor'

   .. py:method:: tensor() -> _ods_ir


.. py:function:: dealloc_tensor(tensor, *, loc=None, ip=None) -> DeallocTensorOp

.. py:class:: MaterializeInDestinationOp(result, source, dest, *, restrict=None, writable=None, loc=None, ip=None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`_ods_ir`


   
   This op indicates that the data of the ``source`` tensor is guaranteed to
   materialize in ``dest``, which can be a tensor or a memref. In case of a
   tensor, ``source`` materializes in the future buffer of ``dest`` and a the
   updated destination tensor is returned. If this is not possible, e.g.,
   because the destination tensor is read-only or because its original
   contents are still read later, the input IR fails to bufferize. In case of a
   memref, ``source`` materializes in ``dest``, which is already a buffer. The op
   has no results in that case.

   ``source``, ``dest`` and ``result`` (if present) must have the same runtime shape
   and element type. If the op has a result, the types of ``result`` and ``dest``
   must match exactly (e.g., including any tensor encodings).

   By default, this op bufferizes to a memcpy from the future buffer of the
   ``source`` tensor to the future buffer of the ``dest`` tensor or to the ``dest``
   buffer. However, transformations such as "empty tensor elimination" may
   rewrite IR such that a computation is performed directly in ``dest`` and no
   memcpy is needed.

   If ``dest`` is a buffer, the ``writable`` attribute must be specified and the
   ``restrict`` keyword can be specified. These attributes have the same meaning
   as the respective attributes of ``bufferization.to_tensor``.

   ``writable`` indicates that the ``dest`` buffer is considered writable. It does
   not make sense to materialize a computation in a read-only buffer, so
   ``writable`` is required.

   ``restrict`` indicates that there is no ``bufferization.to_tensor`` op and no
   other ``bufferization.materialize_in_destination`` op with ``dest`` (or an alias
   thereof) and "restrict". Only ops with this attribute are considered for
   "empty tensor elimination". As part of empty tensor elimination, a new
   ``to_tensor`` op with ``dest`` may be inserted and the ``restrict`` attribute is
   transferred from this op to the new ``to_tensor`` op. Having "restrict" on
   this op guarantees that performing empty tensor elimination would not create
   invalid IR (i.e., having multiple ``to_tensor restrict`` with aliasing
   buffers).

   Note: ``writable`` could be removed from this op because it must always be set
   for memref destinations. This op has that attribute to make clear the
   requirements on the ``dest`` operand in the op assembly format.

   Note: If ``dest`` is a tensor, ``tensor.insert_slice`` could be used for the
   same purpose, but since tensor dialect ops only indicate *what* should be
   computed but not *where*, it could fold away, causing the computation to
   materialize in a different buffer.

.. py:class:: ToBufferOp(buffer, tensor, *, read_only=None, loc=None, ip=None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`_ods_ir`


   
   An operation that returns the future buffer of a ``tensor``.

   .. code:: mlir

       // Result type is memref<4x?xf32, #layout, 0>
       %m = bufferization.to_buffer %t : tensor<4x?xf32> to memref<4x?xf32, #layout, 0>

   This operation is a specialized variant of the built-in
   ``unrealized_conversion_cast`` and is used to make sure that the IR stays
   valid at any point during the bufferization.

   The ``read_only`` attribute can optionally be set, indicating to the
   bufferization that the buffer returned by this op (or an alias created from
   the returned buffer) will not be written to.


   .. py:attribute:: OPERATION_NAME
      :value: 'bufferization.to_buffer'



   .. py:attribute:: _ODS_REGIONS
      :value: (0, True)



   .. py:method:: tensor() -> _ods_ir


   .. py:method:: read_only() -> bool


   .. py:method:: buffer() -> _ods_ir


.. py:function:: to_buffer(buffer, tensor, *, read_only=None, loc=None, ip=None) -> _ods_ir

.. py:class:: ToTensorOp(result, buffer, *, restrict=None, writable=None, loc=None, ip=None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`_ods_ir`


   
   An operation that creates a tensor from a buffer. The result value is a
   tensor-like type that must match the corresponding buffer-like operand as
   per TensorLikeType::verifyCompatibleBufferType(). For builtins (TensorType
   and BaseMemRefType), this means that shapes and element types match between
   the tensor and the buffer.

   The opposite of this op is ``to_buffer``. Together, these two ops are
   useful for source/target materializations when doing type conversions
   involving tensors and buffers.

   Example:

   .. code:: mlir

       // Produces a value of tensor<4x?xf32> type.
       %t = bufferization.to_tensor %m : memref<4x?xf32, #layout, 0> to tensor<4x?xf32>

   If the ``writable`` unit attribute is set, the produced tensor is considered
   "writable" during bufferization. Otherwise, every OpOperand that bufferizes
   to a write to the future buffer of the resulting tensor (or an alias
   thereof) will bufferize out-of-place to prevent emitting any writes to
   ``memref`` during bufferization.

   The ``restrict`` unit attribute (similar to the C ``restrict`` keyword)
   indicates that the produced tensor result is the only way for the tensor
   IR to gain access to the ``memref`` operand (or an alias thereof). E.g.,
   there must be no other ``to_tensor`` op with the same or with an aliasing
   ``memref`` operand.

   Note: Only ``to_tensor`` ops with the ``restrict`` unit attribute are supported
   by One-Shot Bufferize. Other IR is rejected. (To support ``to_tensor``
   without ``restrict``, One-Shot Bufferize would have to analyze memref IR.)
   Ops that have incorrect usage of ``restrict`` may bufferize incorrectly.

   Example:

   .. code::

       %t = bufferization.to_tensor %m restrict writable : memref<4xf32> to tensor<4xf32>
       
       // %t is writable, so the tensor.insert may bufferize in-place in the
       // absence of other conflicts.
       %r = tensor.insert %f into %t[%idx] : tensor<4xf32>

   ``to_tensor`` ops are not bufferized. They are expected to fold away after
   bufferization. If there are non-bufferizable ops in the IR and
   ``allowUnknownOps`` is set, they may be part of the resulting IR and not fold
   away. However, such IR is no longer bufferizable with One-Shot Bufferize.
