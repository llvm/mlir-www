Search for an operation name below (e.g., `linalg.matvec`) to find a list of
all Pattern classes that insert, erase, or modify that operation.

The search index used here is generated by running all `lit` tests in MLIR with
the additional flag `--pattern-logging-listener`, which produces a record of
each rewrite operation and the names of the operations it affected.

Caveats:

 - Some records may be missing due to incomplete test coverage.
 - Patterns are only indexed if they define a `debugName`, and while most
   patterns have one, they are not required to.
 - Patterns defined in PDLL are not supported.
 - Dialect Conversion patterns are only partially supported (only insertions).
