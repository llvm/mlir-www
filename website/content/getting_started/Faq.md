## What is the difference between the Tensor and Vector types?

1) Conceptual: vectors are meant to and occur in lower level dialects - often where you expect hardware to have registers of that size. Tensors model higher-level "closer to the source" abstract representation. This is reflected in the abstraction modeled by the operations from the [`vector` dialect](https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Dialects/Vector/), while Tensors would be more naturally present in the operations of the [`linalg dialect](https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Dialects/Linalg/).
2) Tensors can be dynamically shaped, unranked, or have 0 dimensions ; but Vectors can be.
3) You can have a memref (a buffer in memory) containing Vectors but you can't have a memref of a tensor type.
4) The set of allowed element types is different: the Tensor type isn't limited while Vector is limited to float and integer types.
