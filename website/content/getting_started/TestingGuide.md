## Quickstart commands

These commands are explained below in more detail. All commands are run from the
cmake build directory `build/`, after [building the project](/getting_started/).

### Run all MLIR tests:

```sh
cmake --build . --target check-mlir
```

### Run integration tests (requires `-DMLIR_INCLUDE_INTEGRATION_TESTS=ON`):

```sh
cmake --build . --target check-mlir-integration
```

### Run C++ unit tests:

```sh
bin/llvm-lit -v tools/mlir/test/Unit
```

### Run `lit` tests in a specific directory

```sh
bin/llvm-lit -v tools/mlir/test/Dialect/Arith
```

### Run a specific `lit` test file

```sh
bin/llvm-lit -v tools/mlir/test/Dialect/Polynomial/ops.mlir
```

## Test categories

### `lit` and `FileCheck` tests

[`FileCheck`](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.html) is a tool that
"reads two files (one from standard input, and one specified on the command
line) and uses one to verify the other." One file contains a set of `CHECK` tags
that specify strings and patterns expected to appear in the other file. MLIR
utilizes [`lit`](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/lit.html) to orchestrate the
execution of tools like `mlir-opt` to produce an output, and `FileCheck` to
verify different aspects of the IRâ€”such as the output of a transformation pass.

The source files of `lit`/`FileCheck` tests are organized within the `mlir`
source tree under `mlir/test/`. Within this directory, tests are organized
roughly mirroring `mlir/include/mlir/`, including subdirectories for `Dialect/`,
`Transforms/`, `Conversion/`, etc.

#### Example

An example `FileCheck` test is shown below:

```mlir
// RUN: mlir-opt %s -cse | FileCheck %s

// CHECK-LABEL: func.func @simple_constant
func.func @simple_constant() -> (i32, i32) {
  // CHECK-NEXT: %[[RESULT:.*]] = arith.constant 1
  // CHECK-NEXT: return %[[RESULT]], %[[RESULT]]

  %0 = arith.constant 1 : i32
  %1 = arith.constant 1 : i32
  return %0, %1 : i32, i32
}
```

A comment with `RUN` represents a `lit` directive specifying a command line
invocation to run, with special substitutions like `%s` for the current file. A
comment with `CHECK` represents a `FileCheck` directive to assert a string or
pattern appears in the output.

The above test asserts that, after running Common Subexpression Elimination
(`-cse`), only one constant remains in the IR, and the sole SSA value is
returned twice from the function.

#### Build system details

The main way to run all the tests mentioned above in a single invocation can be
done using the `check-mlir` target:

```sh
cmake --build . --target check-mlir
```

Invoking the `check-mlir` target is roughly equivalent to running (from the
build directory, after building):

```shell
./bin/llvm-lit tools/mlir/test
```

See the [Lit Documentation](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/lit.html) for a
description of all options.

Subsets of the testing tree can be invoked by passing a more specific path
instead of `tools/mlir/test` above. Example:

```shell
./bin/llvm-lit tools/mlir/test/Dialect/Arith

# Note that it is possible to test at the file granularity, but since these
# files do not actually exist in the build directory, you need to know the
# name.
./bin/llvm-lit tools/mlir/test/Dialect/Arith/ops.mlir
```

Or for running all the C++ unit-tests:

```shell
./bin/llvm-lit tools/mlir/test/Unit
```

The C++ unit-tests can also be executed as individual binaries, which is
convenient when iterating on cycles of rebuild-test:

```shell
# Rebuild the minimum amount of libraries needed for the C++ MLIRIRTests
cmake --build . --target tools/mlir/unittests/IR/MLIRIRTests

# Invoke the MLIRIRTest C++ Unit Test directly
tools/mlir/unittests/IR/MLIRIRTests

# It works for specific C++ unit-tests as well:
LIT_OPTS="--filter=MLIRIRTests -a" cmake --build . --target check-mlir

# Run just one specific subset inside the MLIRIRTests:
tools/mlir/unittests/IR/MLIRIRTests --gtest_filter=OpPropertiesTest.Properties
```

Lit has a number of options that control test execution. Here are some of the
most useful for development purposes:

*   [`--filter=REGEXP`](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/lit.html#cmdoption-lit-filter) :
    Only runs tests whose name matches the REGEXP. Can also be specified via the
    `LIT_FILTER` environment variable.
*   [`--filter-out=REGEXP`](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/lit.html#cmdoption-lit-filter-out) :
    Filters out tests whose name matches the REGEXP. Can also be specified via
    the `LIT_FILTER_OUT` environment variable.
*   [`-a`](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/lit.html#cmdoption-lit-a) : Shows
    all information (useful while iterating on a small set of tests).
*   [`--time-tests`](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/lit.html#cmdoption-lit-time-tests) :
    Prints timing statistics about slow tests and overall histograms.

Any Lit options can be set in the `LIT_OPTS` environment variable. This is
especially useful when using the build system target `check-mlir`.

Examples:

```
# Only run tests that have "python" in the name and print all invocations.
LIT_OPTS="--filter=python -a" cmake --build . --target check-mlir

# Only run the array_attributes python test, using the LIT_FILTER mechanism.
LIT_FILTER="python/ir/array_attributes" cmake --build . --target check-mlir

# Run everything except for example and integration tests (which are both
# somewhat slow).
LIT_FILTER_OUT="Examples|Integrations" cmake --build . --target check-mlir
```

Note that the above use the generic cmake command for invoking the `check-mlir`
target, but you can typically use the generator directly to be more concise
(i.e. if configured for `ninja`, then `ninja check-mlir` can replace the `cmake
--build . --target check-mlir` command). We use generic `cmake` commands in
documentation for consistency, but being concise is often better for interactive
workflows.

### Diagnostic tests

MLIR provides rich source location tracking that can be used to emit errors,
warnings, etc. from anywhere throughout the codebase, which are jointly called
*diagnostics*. Diagnostic tests assert that specific diagnostic messages are
emitted for a given input program. These tests are useful in that they allow
checking specific invariants of the IR without transforming or changing
anything.

Some examples of tests in this category are:

-   Verifying invariants of operations
-   Checking the expected results of an analysis
-   Detecting malformed IR

Diagnostic verification tests are written utilizing the
[source manager verifier handler](../docs/Diagnostics#sourcemgr-diagnostic-verifier-handler),
which is enabled via the `verify-diagnostics` flag in `mlir-opt`.

An example .mlir test running under `mlir-opt` is shown below:

```mlir
// RUN: mlir-opt %s -split-input-file -verify-diagnostics

// Expect an error on the same line.
func.func @bad_branch() {
  cf.br ^missing  // expected-error {{reference to an undefined block}}
}

// -----

// Expect an error on an adjacent line.
func.func @foo(%a : f32) {
  // expected-error@+1 {{invalid predicate attribute specification: "foo"}}
  %result = arith.cmpf "foo", %a, %a : f32
  return
}
```

### Integration tests

Integration tests are `FileCheck` tests that verify functional correctness of
MLIR code by running it, usually by means of JIT compilation using
`mlir-cpu-runner` and runtime support libraries.

Integration tests don't run by default. To enable them, set the
`-DMLIR_INCLUDE_INTEGRATION_TESTS=ON` flag during `cmake` configuration as
described in [Getting Started](_index.md).

```sh
cmake -G Ninja ../llvm \
   ... \
   -DMLIR_INCLUDE_INTEGRATION_TESTS=ON \
   ...
```

Now the integration tests run as part of regular testing.

```sh
cmake --build . --target check-mlir
```

To run only the integration tests, run the `check-mlir-integration` target.

```sh
cmake --build . --target check-mlir-integration
```

Note that integration tests are relatively expensive to run (primarily due to
JIT compilation), and tend to be trickier to debug (with multiple compilation
steps _integrated_, it usually takes a bit of triaging to find the root cause
of a failure). We reserve e2e tests for cases that are hard to verify
otherwise, e.g. when composing and testing complex compilation pipelines. In
those cases, verifying run-time output tends to be easier then the checking
e.g. LLVM IR with FileCheck. Lowering optimized `linalg.matmul` (with tiling
and vectorization) is a good example. For less involved lowering pipelines or
when there's almost 1-1 mapping between an Op and it's LLVM IR counterpart
(e.g. `arith.cmpi` and LLVM IR `icmp` instruction),  regular unit tests are considered
enough.

The source files of the integration tests are organized within the `mlir` source
tree by dialect (for example, `test/Integration/Dialect/Vector`).

#### Hardware emulators

The integration tests include some tests for targets that are not widely
available yet, such as specific AVX512 features (like `vp2intersect`) and the
Intel AMX instructions. These tests require an emulator to run correctly
(lacking real hardware, of course). To enable these specific tests, first
download and install the
[Intel Emulator](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-software-development-emulator.html).
Then, include the following additional configuration flags in the initial set up
(X86Vector and AMX can be individually enabled or disabled), where `<path to
emulator>` denotes the path to the installed emulator binary. `sh cmake -G Ninja
../llvm \ ... \ -DMLIR_INCLUDE_INTEGRATION_TESTS=ON \
-DMLIR_RUN_X86VECTOR_TESTS=ON \ -DMLIR_RUN_AMX_TESTS=ON \
-DINTEL_SDE_EXECUTABLE=<path to emulator> \ ...` After this one-time set up, the
tests run as shown earlier, but will now include the indicated emulated tests as
well.

### C++ Unit tests

Unit tests are written using the
[googletest](https://google.github.io/googletest/) framework and are located in
the `mlir/unittests/` directory.

## Contributor guidelines

In general, all commits to the MLIR repository should include an accompanying
test of some form. Commits that include no functional changes, such as API
changes like symbol renaming, should be tagged with NFC (No Functional Changes).
This signals to the reviewer why the change doesn't/shouldn't include a test.

`lit` tests with `FileCheck` are the preferred method of testing in MLIR for
non-erroneous output verification.

Diagnostic tests are the preferred method of asserting error messages are output
correctly. Every user-facing error message (e.g., `op.emitError()`) should be
accompanied by a corresponding diagnostic test.

When you cannot use the above, such as for testing a non-user-facing API like a
data structure, then you may write C++ unit tests. This is preferred because the
C++ APIs are not stable and subject to frequent refactoring. Using `lit` and
`FileCheck` allows maintainers to improve the MLIR internals more easily.

### FileCheck best practices

FileCheck is an extremely useful utility, it allows for easily matching various
parts of the output. This ease of use means that it becomes easy to write
brittle tests that are essentially `diff` tests. FileCheck tests should be as
self-contained as possible and focus on testing the minimal set of
functionalities needed. Let's see an example:

```mlir
// RUN: mlir-opt %s -cse | FileCheck %s

// CHECK-LABEL: func.func @simple_constant() -> (i32, i32)
func.func @simple_constant() -> (i32, i32) {
  // CHECK-NEXT: %result = arith.constant 1 : i32
  // CHECK-NEXT: return %result, %result : i32, i32
  // CHECK-NEXT: }

  %0 = arith.constant 1 : i32
  %1 = arith.constant 1 : i32
  return %0, %1 : i32, i32
}
```

The above example is another way to write the original example shown in the main
[`lit` and `FileCheck` tests](#lit-and-filecheck-tests) section. There are a few
problems with this test; below is a breakdown of the no-nos of this test to
specifically highlight best practices.

*   Tests should be self-contained.

This means that tests should not test lines or sections outside of what is
intended. In the above example, we see lines such as `CHECK-NEXT: }`. This line
in particular is testing pieces of the Parser/Printer of FuncOp, which is
outside of the realm of concern for the CSE pass. This line should be removed.

*   Tests should be minimal, and only check what is absolutely necessary.

This means that anything in the output that is not core to the functionality
that you are testing should *not* be present in a CHECK line. This is a separate
bullet just to highlight the importance of it, especially when checking against
IR output.

If we naively remove the unrelated `CHECK` lines in our source file, we may end
up with:

```mlir
// CHECK-LABEL: func.func @simple_constant
func.func @simple_constant() -> (i32, i32) {
  // CHECK-NEXT: %result = arith.constant 1 : i32
  // CHECK-NEXT: return %result, %result : i32, i32

  %0 = arith.constant 1 : i32
  %1 = arith.constant 1 : i32
  return %0, %1 : i32, i32
}
```

It may seem like this is a minimal test case, but it still checks several
aspects of the output that are unrelated to the CSE transformation. Namely the
result types of the `arith.constant` and `return` operations, as well the actual
SSA value names that are produced. FileCheck `CHECK` lines may contain
[regex statements](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.html#filecheck-regex-matching-syntax)
as well as named
[string substitution blocks](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.html#filecheck-string-substitution-blocks).
Utilizing the above, we end up with the example shown in the main
[FileCheck tests](#filecheck-tests) section.

```mlir
// CHECK-LABEL: func.func @simple_constant
func.func @simple_constant() -> (i32, i32) {
  /// Here we use a substitution variable as the output of the constant is
  /// useful for the test, but we omit as much as possible of everything else.
  // CHECK-NEXT: %[[RESULT:.*]] = arith.constant 1
  // CHECK-NEXT: return %[[RESULT]], %[[RESULT]]

  %0 = arith.constant 1 : i32
  %1 = arith.constant 1 : i32
  return %0, %1 : i32, i32
}
```
