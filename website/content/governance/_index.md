MLIR is part of the LLVM project and is subject to its [governance rules](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-www/blob/main/proposals/LP0004-project-governance.md). As an important LLVM subproject, MLIR has a dedicated area team whose main role is to facilitate decision-making within the project, in particular by nominating maintainers.

As of 2025, the area team consists of:

 - [Alex Zinenko](https://github.com/ftynse/) (chair)
 - [Renato Golin](https://github.com/rengolin/) (secretary)
 - [Jacques Pienaar](https://github.com/jpienaar)
 - [Matthias Springer](https://github.com/matthias-springer/)

Members of the area team are also members of the project community at large and the preferred method of contacting them are through the usual community channels.
