To root cause the problem or help verification after fixes, developers want to be able to reduce the size of a reproducer for a bug. This document describes mlir-reduce, which is similar to bugpoint, a tool that can reduce the size of the input needed to trigger the error.</description></item><item><title>mlir-rewrite</title><link>https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Tools/mlir-rewrite/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Tools/mlir-rewrite/</guid><description>Tool to simplify rewriting .mlir files. There are a couple of build in rewrites discussed below along with usage.
Note: This is still in very early stage. Its so early its less a tool than a growing collection of useful functions: to use its best to do what&amp;rsquo;s needed on a brance by just hacking it (dialects registered, rewrites etc) to say help ease a rename, upstream useful utility functions, point to ease others migrating, and then bin eventually.</description></item></channel></rss>
